Fonts, Assets, SFML Library all need to be downloaded separately to run this application. 

Positions extracted from Lichess FEN Puzzle database. 

Position shows for 5 seconds, and board has to be recreated by dragging all 12 types of pieces. Can check at any time, or clear board, or restart with a new position.

Feel free to make improvements.
